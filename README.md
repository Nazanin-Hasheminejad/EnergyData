# EnergyData
 I cloned data from https://github.com/owid/energy-data/blob/master/owid-energy-data.csv, which includes data on energy consumption, electricity mix, and other metrics. Here, you can find my procedure for constructing a relational database, data cleaning, and visualizations based on this dataset.
